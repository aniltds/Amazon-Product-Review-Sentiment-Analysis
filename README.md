The available data is of consumer reviews for different Amazon products (Alexa, Kindle, Fire TV Stick)

The major challenge is to predict the sentiment from large imbalanced dataset.

Main tasks performed in this project are 

o	Data Cleaning, 

o	Analyzed different types of trends and pattern based on reviews

o	For data balancing use SMOTE technique

o	Used different types of word embedding methods (TF-IDF and Word2Vec)

o Used Probablity based, Tree based and Ensambled machine learning models

o Also tried using Simple RNN and LSTM deep learning models 

o	For model evaluation used F1 macro avg metric because of very high imbalance data

o For clustering similiar groups used Kmeans clustering

o For Topic modelling used LDA and Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)
